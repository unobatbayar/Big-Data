Amdahl's Law. Formula for Parallel Computing, quantify


Slatency is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task;
s is the speedup of the part of the task that benefits from improved system resources;
p is the proportion of execution time that the part benefiting from improved resources originally occupied.

source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law

It says, speedup we expect depends on two factors:
1) proportion of parallelism
2) number of processors
